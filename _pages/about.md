Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at [Operations Research Center (ORC)](https://orc.mit.edu/), MIT where I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Dr. Rahul Mazumder](https://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/) and [Dr. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu). 

Prior to MIT, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Operations Research from Rice University.

My research interests lie broadly in optimization algorithms - particularly those for training machine learning models. In the past, I have also worked in dynamical systems and computational fluid dynamics.
